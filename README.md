# CVAE implementation in ZhuSuan
This repository contains an implementation of a Class-conditioned VAE (CVAE) using [ZhuSuan](https://github.com/thu-ml/zhusuan) on the MNIST dataset.
This is a coding assignment from the Machine Learning course at Tsinghua University, Fall Semester 2020.  

# Installation
Clone the repository and install the requirements in your machine by running:
```
(venv) pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Note: It is recommended to use a virtual environment to install all the dependencies.

# Quick start
You can train a model by running the following command and changing the arguments accordingly. `Arguments in square brackets are optional (all arguments)`.
```
(venv) python3 cvae.py [--gpu <DEVICE_ID>]

                       [--zdim <Z_DIM>]
                       [--lr <LEARNING_RATE>] 
                       [--epochs <NUMBER_OF_EPOCHS>]
                       [--batch_size <BATCH_SIZE>]

                       [--save_model_freq <...>]
                       [--save_img_freq <...>]

                       [--data_dir <path to the dataset>]
                       [--results_path <path to save the results>]
                       [--checkpoints_path <path to save the model weights>]
```

# Results
A model trained after 100 epochs with learning rate of 0.001 can generate images like these:
